This problem is known as the assignment problem. The assignment problem is a special case of the transportation problem, which in turn is a special case of the min-cost flow problem, so it can be solved using algorithms that solve the more general cases. Also, our problem is a special case of binary integer linear programming problem (which is NP-hard). But, due to the specifics of the problem, there are more efficient algorithms to solve it. We’ll handle the assignment problem with the Hungarian algorithm (or Kuhn-Munkres algorithm). I’ll illustrate two different implementations of this algorithm, both graph theoretic, one easy and fast to implement with O(n4) complexity, and the other one with O(n3) complexity, but harder to implement.

There are also implementations of Hungarian algorithm that do not use graph theory. Rather, they just operate with cost matrix, making different transformation of it (see [1] for clear explanation). We’ll not touch these approaches, because it’s less practical for TopCoder needs.
